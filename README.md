# Pokedex

A user interface using the pokeAPI to display an image with some basic information such as height, weight, type and x2 abilities for each successful pokemon search query. Currently as it stands, the page is simple. Plan to update the html structure and css to make the it responsive for mobile and more visually appealing. **08/07/24**
